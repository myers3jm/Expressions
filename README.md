# Expressions
A Java program which evaluates mathematical expressions.

The program reads in a series of mathematical expressions from sampleIn.txt, and evaluates them.
If an expression is invalidly formatted (such as missing parentheses) the program will not attempt to evaluate it, and will print all invalid expressions after execution.
